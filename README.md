# WebRipper
An open-source archival tool for websites optimized and tested on Windows 11.

# Operation instructions
Download the Windows executable (or the source code, if you wish to modify it) and open it.
Then type in a URL (https://, http:// or another protocol must be specified). You should also supply a full path to where the site should be downloaded to.

Afterwards a (often corrupted, no idea why) file should open in your browser.

# Errors and other messages
Sometimes, errors can occur which will prevent the site from downloading. If this happens to you, there's nothing you can do about it, but there's no files that you need to purge, either.

In general, you should see a lot of messages (and even errors!) when downloading sites.

# Fixing a case of the freezing program
Sometimes a website (e.g, https://tidal.com) has so many resources to download that your WebRipper appears to be inoperational.
To fix this, first try unhighlighting any text, focusing the window, and then finally, pressing CTRL + C on your keyboard.
If this doesn't work (which is very common) then you should close the window.

If this doesn't work (very uncommon; never happened to me before) then save your work and restart.

If this doesn't resolve your issue, please file a bug report with info about your computer, including your CPU and OS info, along with your edition of that OS (if applicable).

After resolving a freezing issue, it is recommended to remove any unwanted site files WebRipper may have downloaded before freezing.
